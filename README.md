A personal 
voice assistant is the software that can perform task and provide different services to the 
individual as per the individual’s dictated commands. The voice assistant takes the voice

let us divide the Software into 5 main pieces. 
The first piece is “Activation”, so Lisa gets activated once it hears the keyword “Lisa”. The 
second piece is “Speech-to-text”, Lisa will start recording what the user is saying then 
convert it to text. The third piece is “Intent recognition”, it will try to figure out the move to 
next step. Otherwise, it will ask the user to say that again and go back to speech-to-text. The 
fourth piece is “processing and execution”, which will try to take the proper action, if any, 
based on the intent of what has been said. Otherwise, it will also tell the user it could not take 
a proper action and request user to repeat the command again, and then again, go back to the 
speech-to-text part. The last and the fifth piece is “Text-to-speech”, at this point, Lisa will say 
something back either it in an acknowledgment or a response to what has been requested.
